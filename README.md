🚀 Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos (Updated CVPR 2025)

This is an updated and working version of the CVPR 2018 Anomaly Detection project by Waqas Sultani et al., rewritten for modern Python 3.13, TensorFlow 2.20.0, and Keras.
The original code used Theano and outdated Keras 1.x; this version runs successfully on Windows using CPU.

🧠 About the Project

The system detects abnormal activities in surveillance videos (e.g., accidents, explosions, thefts) using C3D feature representations.
Our implementation performs both training and testing from pre-computed feature text files and achieves accurate anomaly prediction via CMD interface.

🧩 Dataset (Existing Pre-computed)

This implementation uses C3D pre-computed feature datasets from the original CVPR 2018 work:
🔗 UCF Anomaly Detection Dataset (Official Link)
Each video is divided into 32 segments, and each segment contains a 4096-dimensional feature vector extracted from a C3D model.
